            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>These are very light and tender pancakes. These pancakes are excellent with maple syrup.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li> 
                    <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup wheat germ</li>
                    <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>5⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>2½ cups buttermilk</li>
                    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
                    <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
