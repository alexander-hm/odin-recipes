            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast or as a side dish. If you prefer crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                    <li>3 medium russet potatoes, cubed</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
